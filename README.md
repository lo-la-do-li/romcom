# What Does It Do?

This site gives users the ability to choose between randomly generating or custom-making their own romance novel covers!

Upon load up, the site will generate a random cover and the user will have four button at their disposal:
you can generate a new random cover with `Show New Random Cover`, make your own custom cover with `Make Your Own Cover`, save the currently selected cover with `Save` and even browse your own *personal library* of sultry novels with `View Saved Covers`!


## Make Your Own Cover! 

![Your Cover Here](https://scontent.fapa1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/118764029_10160266490683677_8875513111090355122_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&_nc_sid=0debeb&_nc_ohc=r0tfC6r9-ncAX_fGFbw&_nc_ht=scontent.fapa1-2.fna&oh=f46a2e81f2b9a550948984d9725d6a12&oe=5F72FEC6)

Once within the `Make Your Own Cover` section, the user may enter a title, two descriptors and even a link to their favorite image to make it their own! Click `Make My Book` to transform what you've entered into a seductive, steamy novel *more* than worthy of your local drugstore's most middle shelf.

(some personal favorites:)
